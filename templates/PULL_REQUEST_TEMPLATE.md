## Tests added or updated

<!-- Per core/testing.mdc "what every change must add". List the categories. -->

- [ ] Unit (happy, edge, boundary, negative, error)

- [ ] Component + accessibility + visual regression (UI changes)
- [ ] API / contract / error-envelope (endpoints, actions, functions)
- [ ] Database: migration up + down, RLS (anon / owner / other), constraints
- [ ] Integration / webhook: fixtures, signature, retry, timeout, idempotency
- [ ] Job: idempotency, retry, concurrency, dead-letter
- [ ] Auth / authorization per role and resource
- [ ] E2E journey on desktop and mobile viewport
- [ ] Performance benchmark / load scenario (performance-sensitive paths)
- [ ] Regression test for a bug fix (written before the fix)
- [ ] `TEST_PLAN.md` updated (new tooling, commands, or status)
- [ ] Every further test the change allows was added; the rest is in `BACKLOG.md`

## Verification run locally

<!-- Paste the exact commands you ran and their result. Do not tick what you did not run. -->

## Self-review

- [ ] Diff re-read end to end
- [ ] No file > 300 lines, no function > 50 lines (or documented exemption)
- [ ] No commented-out code, debug logging, unlinked TODO, suppressed diagnostic
- [ ] No secrets; no production data touched
- [ ] Refactors in separate commits from features
